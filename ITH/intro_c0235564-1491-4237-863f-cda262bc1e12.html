<p>We request your help in locating a valuable artefact that we have misplaced somewhere in Islington. 
We had several clues about how to find this artefact, but they were also scattered in the neighbourhood. 
Your mission is to visit each location and collect the clues that will lead you to your next stop and ultimately to the artefact. 
At each location you will find a code that will take you to a web page when scanned. 
The clue on the page will point you to an address (street name and a number). 
There will also be an image clue that will guide you to the exact location of the next code. 
</p>

<p>
Also, please be nice to the environment and remove the codes as you find the clues.
</p>

<p>
Your first clue is below. Good luck!
</p>
